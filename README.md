#The Experiment
This is an experiment focused on front-end implementation challenges for the Developer Portal, specifically the API. The content is likely outdated and things won't always match up. The code _is not_ pretty.

##Background
Experimenting with using a [scss version of the Bootstrap library] encoutered issues getting affix.js, the sticky nav, to work. 
After several failed attemps and experiments, approached the problem building from a custom download of standard css and js from the [Bootstrap] website. These are the results.

## What It Uses
- Boostrap 3
- AngularJS

## To fix
- only works locally. 
- getting "SyntaxError : Unexpected token" message on hosted, web version.
